### Cloud Computing

What is Cloud Computing? 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources - such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet (”the cloud”). 

These resources are hosted and managed by cloud service providers (third party) in large data centres. Rather than users keeping files on a hard drive or local storage drive, cloud- based storage enables and makes it possible to save them to remote database. As long as you are connected to the internet,  you are able to access your data from anywhere.

**Key points:** 

- Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the internet, this includes data storage, servers, databases, networking and software.
- Cloud- based storage makes it possible to save files to remote databased and retrieve, modify, access them on demand as long as you are connected to the internet.
- User is not required to be in a specific place to gain access the files in the cloud, allowing the user to work remotely. (one drive, SharePoint etc)
- It eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to self-manage physical resources themselves, and only pay for what they use.
